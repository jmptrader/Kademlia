Querying the DHT
==================

If you just want to query the network, you can use the example query script.  For instance::

  $ python examples/query.py 1.2.3.4 8468 SpecialKey

The query script is simple:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/query.py

Check out the examples folder for other examples.
