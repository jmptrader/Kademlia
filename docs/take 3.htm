<p>Implementing the Kademlia Peer-to-Peer Distributed Hash Table</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Kademlia, according to a paper<sup>1</sup> published in 2015 by Xing Shi Cai 
and Luc Devoyre, &quot;is the defacto standard searching algorithm for P2P 
(peer-to-peer) networks on the Internet.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are two 
different versions of the specification, and both have certain contradictions, 
particularly the second one.&nbsp; This results in a variety of implementations.&nbsp; 
On GitHub, I've found only two that appear both reasonably complete and well 
implemented:</p>
<ol>
	<li>zencoders<sup>2</sup> C# implementation appears to be based on the 
	shorter specification and seems to match Jim Dixon's<sup>3</sup> description 
	of the algorithm.</li>
	<li>Brian Muller<sup>4 </sup>has an excellent implementation in Python based 
	on the longer specification.&nbsp; Note that the Python 3.5 branch should be 
	used, the master branch contains some bugs and is written for Python 2.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What is Kademlia?</h3>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p><i>Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer 
computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières in 2002. It 
specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through 
node lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual 
or overlay network is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified 
by a number or node ID. The node ID serves not only as identification, but the 
Kademlia algorithm uses the node ID to locate values (usually file hashes or 
keywords). In fact, the node ID provides a direct map to file hashes and that 
node stores information on where to obtain the file or resource.</i></p>
<h3>Who Uses Kademlia?</h3>
<p>Kademlia is used in file sharing networks.&nbsp; For example,
BitTorrent<sup>8</sup> uses a DHT 
based on an implementation of the Kademlia algorithm.&nbsp;
Kad network<sup>9</sup> uses the Kademlia protocol, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule">eMule</a> 
being an open source Windows client.</p>
<h3>Why is Kademlia Important?</h3>
<ol>
	<li>The underlying technology of not just cryptocurrency but any blockchain, 
	including those 
	that implements smart 
	contracts<sup>,5</sup> must include a peer-to-peer distributed hash 
	table, at least with regards to how blockchain technology is being discussed 
	and applied (using a blockchain in a centralized scenario is sort of 
	pointless except perhaps for logging purposes.)&nbsp; Understanding how this 
	works is important.</li>
	<li>Centralized data, except for performance reasons, is
	on its way out<sup>6</sup></a>.&nbsp; As that last link states: &quot;The more the data 
	management industry consolidates, the more opposing forces decentralize the 
	market.&quot;&nbsp; And peer-to-peer decentralizing has built in redundancy 
	protecting from single-point data loss and access failures.&nbsp; Not that 
	decentralizing has its own problems -- security will probably be the main 
	one, if it isn't already.&nbsp; As an aside, read this short paper on
	Enigma</a><sup>7</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>While this is a personal venture, it is also a recognition that there are 
some interesting and complicated technologies coming down the road that need to 
be properly understood, and protocols like Kademlia are a good starting point 
for looking at a P2P DHT implementation.&nbsp; As to why Kademlia specifically, 
the summary to the spec says it best:</p>
<p><i>&quot;With its novel XOR-based metric topology, Kademlia is the first 
peer-to-peer system to combine provable consistency and performance, 
latency-minimizing routing, and a symmetric, unidirectional topology. Kademlia 
furthermore introduces a concurrency parameter, a, that lets people trade a 
constant factor in bandwidth for asynchronous lowest-latency hop selection and 
delay-free fault recovery. Finally, Kademlia is the first peer-to-peer system to 
exploit the fact that node failures are inversely related to uptime.&quot;</i></p>
<h3>Where did the Name Come From?</h3>
<p>As <a href="http://www.maymounkov.org/kademlia">Petar Maymounkov</a>, one of 
the co-creators of Kademlia says: &quot;it is a Turkish word for a “lucky man” and, 
more importantly, is the name of a mountain peak in Bulgaria.&quot;&nbsp; OK then.</p>
<h3>Concerns with Existing Implementation</h3>
<p>My major issue with zencoders C# implementation is that it is entangled with 
the intended application -- a P2P audio file application.&nbsp; Brian Muller's 
implementation is a straight forward library.&nbsp; In perusing numerous GitHub 
repo's, I found many implementations that were incomplete or clearly buggy, 
simply by inspecting the code.&nbsp; Beware of what's out there!</p>
<h3>Other Languages</h3>
<p>I have not looked carefully at implementations in other languages, being 
primarily Java and Javascript (personal lack of interest in those languages) and 
Go (lack of familiarity with the language makes it difficult to read.)&nbsp; 
Looking briefly at implementations in these other languages, it's fairly easy to 
tell which version of the specification they implement, so again, beware that 
depending on which specification the author worked with, you can have very 
different implementations.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>C# 7 with .NET framework 4.7 is required to build this code.</p>

<h3>What is Accomplished Here</h3>
<p>The goal in this article is to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Map specification with implementation.</li>
<li>Discover any areas of concern with the specification.</li>
	<li>Abstract key areas of the design so that:<ol>
		<li>Different implementations can be selected.</li>
	<li>Different communication protocols can be used.</li>
		<li>The algorithm can be easily unit tested.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>The Kademlia specification essentially consists of several sub-algorithms:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Registering new peers.</li>
	<li>Updating peer lists.</li>
	<li>Obtaining the closest peer to a key.</li>
<li>Storing and retrieving key-values.</li>
	<li>Managing stale key-value pairs and peers</li>
</ol>
<p>The most complex part of the code is in the registration of new peers, as 
this involves some magic numbers based on the authors' research into the 
performance of other networks as Chord<sup>10</sup> and Pasty<sup>11</sup> and 
the behavior of peers in those networks.</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>The Kademlia specification uses the following terms:</p>
<h4>Node</h4>
<p>A node (also known as a contact) is a peer in the network.</p>
<h4>Node ID</h4>
<p>This is a 160 bit node identifier, obtained from a SHA1 hash.</p>
<h4>k-Bucket</h4>
<p>A collection of at most <i>k</i> nodes.&nbsp; Also simply 
	called a bucket.</p>
<h4>Key-Value</h4>
<p>Peers store values based on 160 bit SHA1 hashed keys.&nbsp; Note that the 
specification does not address:</p>
<ul>
	<li>key collision</li>
	<li>encrypting of values</li>
	<li>privacy of keys</li>
</ul>
<h4>Router</h4>
<p>The router manages the collection of k-buckets and also determines into which 
nodes a key-value should be stored.</p>
<h4>Distance</h4>
<p>The distance between a host and the key is an XOR computation of the host's 
ID with the key.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>High Level Architecture</h2>
<p>In this document, <font color="#FF00FF">fuchsia text</font> is used when 
quoting from the Kademlia specification and other documents.</p>
<p>There are four components to the high level architecture necessary to 
implement the Kademlia protocol:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Node: The concept of a node.&nbsp; Each node has a private 160-bit ID (a 
	SHA-1 hash).&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">Keys are opaque, 160-bit quantities 
	(e.g., the SHA-1 hash of some larger data). Participating computers each 
	have a node ID in the 160-bit key space. </font>(From the Introduction)</li>
	<li>Storage: Each node stores key-value pairs, where the key is also a 
	160-bit SHA-1 hash.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">(key,value) pairs are 
	stored on nodes with IDs “close” to the key for some notion of closeness.</font>&nbsp; 
	The storage mechanism, whether in-memory, key-value database, file system, 
	or other, is not specified and is a good point for abstraction. (From the 
	Introduction)</li>
	<li>Routing: Nearby servers for a given key are located with an efficient 
	routing algorithm.&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">A node- ID-based routing 
	algorithm lets anyone efficiently locate servers near any given target key. </font>
	(From the Introduction)</li>
	<li>Communication protocol: a means of communicating between nodes (usually 
	separate computers) must exist.&nbsp; The original Kademlia specification 
	states that <font color="#FF00FF">every node keeps a list of (IP address, 
	UDP port, Node ID)</font> of nearby nodes.&nbsp; As with storage, this is a 
	good place for abstraction so that different protocols can be easily 
	employed. (Section 2.2 of the spec)</li>
