<h2><a name="Introduction0">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Kademlia, according to a paper<sup>1</sup> published in 2015 by Xing Shi Cai 
and Luc Devoyre, &quot;is the defacto standard searching algorithm for P2P 
(peer-to-peer) networks on the Internet.&quot;&nbsp; It seemed like a good 
choice for doing a deep dive in P2P DHT implementations, ideally finding a solid 
existing implementation rather than rolling my own.&nbsp; Alas, it was not to 
be.&nbsp; As it turns out, there are two 
different versions of the specification, both having certain contradictions, 
particularly the second one.&nbsp; This results in a variety of implementations, 
and most tend to have a loose interpretation of the contradictory and ambiguous 
aspects of the specification.&nbsp; 
On GitHub, I've found only two that appear both reasonably complete and well 
implemented:</p>
<ol>
	<li>zencoders<sup>2</sup> C# implementation appears to be based on the 
	shorter specification and seems to match Jim Dixon's<sup>3</sup> description 
	of the algorithm.</li>
	<li>Brian Muller<sup>4 </sup>has an excellent implementation in Python based 
	on the longer specification.&nbsp; 
	</li>
</ol>
<p><img border="0" src="note.png" width="24" height="32"> Note that the Python 3.5 branch should be 
	used, the master branch contains some bugs and is written for Python 2.</p>
<p>Rarely do I end up with multiple versions of an article.&nbsp; What started 
off with the intent of &quot;here's the spec, let's find someone that did a decent 
job coding it&quot; quickly became &quot;here's the spec, let's roll our own using the 
spec&quot; to &quot;wait, the spec is contradicting itself here, it's confusing there, and 
ambiguous over there&quot; to &quot;OMG, there's two different versions of the spec!&quot;&nbsp; 
As a result, this is actually my third pass at writing an article on Kademlia 
that makes some kind of sense.&nbsp; Special thanks go to Brian Muller who has 
put up with a lot of my questions about the specification itself.</p>
<h3><a name="WhatisKademlia1">What is Kademlia?</a></h3>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p><i>Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer 
computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazi�res in 2002. It 
specifies the structure of the network and the exchange of information through 
node lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual 
or overlay network is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified 
by a number or node ID. The node ID serves not only as identification, but the 
Kademlia algorithm uses the node ID to locate values (usually file hashes or 
keywords). In fact, the node ID provides a direct map to file hashes and that 
node stores information on where to obtain the file or resource.</i></p>
<h3><a name="WhoUsesKademlia2">Who Uses Kademlia?</a></h3>
<p>Kademlia is used in file sharing networks.&nbsp; For example,
BitTorrent<sup>8</sup> uses a DHT 
based on an implementation of the Kademlia algorithm.&nbsp;
Kad network<sup>9</sup> uses the Kademlia protocol, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule">eMule</a> 
being an open source Windows client.</p>
<h3><a name="WhyisKademliaImportant3">Why is Kademlia Important?</a></h3>
<ol>
	<li>The underlying technology of not just cryptocurrency but any blockchain, 
	including those 
	that implements smart 
	contracts<sup>,5</sup> must include a peer-to-peer distributed hash 
	table, at least with regards to how blockchain technology is being discussed 
	and applied (using a blockchain in a centralized scenario is sort of 
	pointless except perhaps for logging purposes.)&nbsp; Understanding how this 
	works is important.</li>
	<li>Centralized data, except for performance reasons, is
	on its way out<sup>6</sup></a>.&nbsp; As that last link states: &quot;The more the data 
	management industry consolidates, the more opposing forces decentralize the 
	market.&quot;&nbsp; And peer-to-peer decentralizing has built in redundancy 
	protecting from single-point data loss and access failures.&nbsp; Not that 
	decentralizing has its own problems -- security will probably be the main 
	one, if it isn't already.&nbsp; As an aside, read this short paper on
	Enigma</a><sup>7</sup>.</li>
</ol>
<p>While this is a personal venture, it is also a recognition that there are 
some interesting and complicated technologies coming down the road that need to 
be properly understood, and protocols like Kademlia are a good starting point 
for looking at a P2P DHT implementation.&nbsp; As to why Kademlia specifically, 
the summary to the spec says it best:</p>
<p><i>&quot;With its novel XOR-based metric topology, Kademlia is the first 
peer-to-peer system to combine provable consistency and performance, 
latency-minimizing routing, and a symmetric, unidirectional topology. Kademlia 
furthermore introduces a concurrency parameter, a, that lets people trade a 
constant factor in bandwidth for asynchronous lowest-latency hop selection and 
delay-free fault recovery. Finally, Kademlia is the first peer-to-peer system to 
exploit the fact that node failures are inversely related to uptime.&quot;</i></p>
<h3><a name="WheredidtheNameComeFrom4">Where did the Name Come From?</a></h3>
<p>As <a href="http://www.maymounkov.org/kademlia">Petar Maymounkov</a>, one of 
the co-creators of Kademlia says: &quot;it is a Turkish word for a �lucky man� and, 
more importantly, is the name of a mountain peak in Bulgaria.&quot;&nbsp; OK then.</p>
<h3><a name="ConcernswithExistingImplementation5">Concerns with Existing Implementation</a></h3>
<p>My major issue with zencoders C# implementation is that it is entangled with 
the intended application -- a P2P audio file application.&nbsp; Brian Muller's 
implementation is a straight forward library.&nbsp; In perusing numerous GitHub 
repo's, I found many implementations that were incomplete or clearly buggy, 
simply by inspecting the code.&nbsp; Beware of what's out there!</p>
<h3><a name="OtherLanguages6">Other Languages</a></h3>
<p>I have not looked carefully at implementations in other languages, those being 
primarily written in Java and Javascript (personal lack of interest in those 
languages) and Go (lack of familiarity with the language makes it difficult to 
read.)&nbsp; Looking briefly at implementations in these other languages, it's 
fairly easy to tell which version of the specification they implement, so again, 
beware that depending on which specification the author worked with, you can 
have very different implementations.&nbsp; For example, an implementation in 
Java makes a very specific (yet seemingly arbitrary) rule about bucket splitting 
(we'll get to that) that isn't found in the spec.</p>
<h3><a name="Requirements7">Requirements</a></h3>
<p>C# 7 with .NET framework 4.7 is required to build this code.</p>

<h3><a name="ThingsKademliaDoesn'tAddress11">Things Kademlia Doesn't Address</a></h3>
<p>Some of the things the specification does not address:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Key collisions in key-values.&nbsp; While improbable, the best way to 
	mitigate this is to have your own peer create a random key for you, so we 
	don't all create a key called &quot;Nancy's Number.&quot;</li>
	<li>Peer ID collision - again, the node ID should be created for you, so we 
	don't all create peers called &quot;Marc's Peer.&quot;</li>
	<li>Encrypting of values.</li>
	<li>Privacy of keys - while not practical with today's technology, a 
	malicious peer could query for stored values across the entire 2<sup>160</sup> 
	key space.</li>
	<li>Serialization format of packets sent over the wire.</li>
	<li>Ability to limit what a peer stores based on value length.&nbsp; I 
	certainly don't want to store the value for the key &quot;TheWholeInternet.&quot;</li>
	<li>Private peer groups -- joining a public P2P network but creating a 
	private peer group within the network.</li>
	<li>Partial participation -- What if you want to participate in a peer network for storing / 
	retrieving key-values, but don't want to store key-values yourself?&nbsp; 
	Perhaps you're running an IoT device with limited storage?</li>
	<li>Registering multiple peer ID's from the same network address - this is 
	of particular concern because you can use this to degrade the performance of 
	a peer, as discussed in the section "Degrading a Kademlia Peer."</li>
	<li>Our peer tampering with a value when it propagates the value to other 
	peers.&nbsp; This can be remedied by including a public key to ensure the 
	value hasn't been changed.&nbsp; And while it's strange to say &quot;our peer&quot;, 
	it becomes an issue when you download a peer application and you have no 
	idea what's going on inside -- and even if you had the source, would you 
	look, and know where to look?</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="WhatisAccomplishedHere12">What is Accomplished Here</a></h3>
<p>The goal in this article is to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Map specification with implementation.</li>
<li>Discover any areas of concern with the specification.</li>
	<li>Abstract key areas of the design so that:<ol>
		<li>Different implementations can be selected.</li>
	<li>Different communication protocols can be used.</li>
		<li>The algorithm can be easily unit tested.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Notation13">Notation</a></h3>
<p>In this document, <font color="#FF00FF">fuchsia text</font> is used when 
quoting from the Kademlia specification and other documents.</p>
<h3><a name="AWordAbouttheUnitTests14">A Word About the Unit Tests</a></h3>
<p>Some of the unit tests set up specific conditions for testing code.&nbsp; 
Others use a randomly generated ID's (node ID's and keys) and verify results 
through a different implementation of the same algorithm.&nbsp; Those tests 
should probably be revised to set up specific conditions.&nbsp; To mitigate 
one's horror at using random values in unit tests, the Random class is seed in 
debug mode with the same value, and is exposed as a public static field so that 
some unit tests can perform their tests with a range of seeds:</p>
<pre>#if DEBUG
public static Random rnd = new Random(1);
#else
private static Random rnd = new Random();
#endif</pre>
<p>At some point I might put more work into improving the unit tests and 
removing the random ID key generation, except for the distribution tests of 
course.</p>
<p>Also, most of these unit tests are really system-level tests, or at least 
partial system tests.&nbsp; Actual unit tests of specific code sections in a 
particular method, well, it gets inane rather quickly.&nbsp; So you'll see a lot 
of setup stuff being done in the higher level tests.</p>
<h3><a name="AWordAbouttheCode&nbsp;15">A Word About the Code&nbsp; </a></h3>
<p>The code presented here is incremental, meaning that as additional features 
are discussed and added, code is updated to reflect those new features and their 
unit tests.&nbsp; Not every refactoring is included in the code here, therefore 
its strongly recommended if you're interested in a particular method, use the 
final implementation in the actual code base.</p>

<h2><a name="KeyConcepts16">Key Concepts</a></h2>
<p>The Kademlia specification essentially consists of several sub-algorithms:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Registering new peers.</li>
	<li>Updating peer lists.</li>
	<li>Obtaining the closest peer to a key.</li>
<li>Storing and retrieving key-values.</li>
	<li>Managing stale key-value pairs and peers</li>
</ol>
<p>The most complex part of the code is in the registration of new peers, as 
this involves some magic numbers based on the authors' research into the 
performance of other networks as Chord<sup>10</sup> and Pasty<sup>11</sup> and 
the behavior of peers in those networks.</p>
<h3><a name="GeneralTerminology17">General Terminology</a></h3>
<p>There are several terms used in general discussions of P2P systems.</p>
<h4><a name="OverlayNetwork18">Overlay Network</a></h4>
<p>An overlay network is one in which each node keeps a (usually partial) list 
of other nodes participating in the network.</p>
<h3><a name="KademliaTerminology19">Kademlia Terminology</a></h3>
<p>Terms used specifically in the Kademlia specification are described here.</p>
<h4><a name="Node20">Node</a></h4>
<p>A node (also known as a contact) is a peer in the network.</p>
<h4><a name="NodeID21">Node ID</a></h4>
<p>This is a 160 bit node identifier, obtained from a SHA1 hash.</p>
<h4><a name="k-Bucket22">k-Bucket</a></h4>
<p>A collection of at most <i>k</i> nodes (or contacts.)&nbsp; Also simply 
	called a bucket.&nbsp; Each node handles up to <i>k</i> contacts within a 
range of ID's.&nbsp; Initially, the ID range is the entire spectrum from 0 &lt;= id 
&lt;= 2<sup>160</sup> - 1.</p>
<h4><a name="Key-Value23">Key-Value</a></h4>
<p>Peers store values based on 160 bit SHA1 hashed keys.&nbsp; Each stored entry 
consists of a key-value pair.</p>
<h4><a name="Router24">Router</a></h4>
<p>The router manages the collection of k-buckets and also determines into which 
nodes a key-value should be stored.</p>
<h4><a name="Distance/&quot;Closeness&quot;25">Distance / &quot;Closeness&quot;</a></h4>
<p>The distance between a host and the key is an XOR computation of the host's 
ID with the key.&nbsp; </p>
<h4><a name="Prefix26">Prefix</a></h4>
<p>A prefix is the term used to describe the <i>n</i> most significant bits (MSB) of an ID.&nbsp; </p>
<h4><a name="Depth27">Depth</a></h4>
<p>The depth of a bucket is defined as the shared prefix of a bucket.&nbsp; 
Since buckets are associated with ranges from 2<sup>i</sup> to 2<sup>i+1</sup> - 
1 where 0 &lt;= i &lt; 160, one could say that the depth of a bucket is 160 - i.&nbsp; 
We'll see later that this may not be the case.</p>
<h4><a name="BucketSplit28">Bucket Split</a></h4>
<p>A bucket split is something potentially happens when a node's k-bucket is 
full -- meaning it has <i>k</i> contacts -- and a new contact wants to register 
within the bucket's range.&nbsp; At this point, an algorithm kicks in that:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Under one condition, splits the bucket at the range midpoint into two 
	ranges, placing contacts into the appropriate new buckets.</li>
	<li>Under a second condition, splits the bucket when a specific depth 
	qualifier is met.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the bucket can't be split, there is a third fallback that replaces an old 
contact that is no longer responding with the new contact.</p>
<h3><a name="CommunicationProtocol29">Communication Protocol</a></h3>
<p>The Kademlia protocol consists of four Remote Procedure Calls (RPC's).&nbsp; 
All RPC's require that the sender provides a random RPC ID which must be echoed 
by the recipient: <font color="#FF00FF">In all RPCs, the recipient must echo a 
160-bit random RPC ID, which provides some resistance to address forgery, PINGS 
can also be piggy-backed on RPC replies for the RPC recipient to obtain 
additional assurance of the sender�s network address.</font></p>
<p>Any time a peer is contacted with any of the four RPC's, it goes through the 
process of adding/updating the contact in its own list.&nbsp; In the description 
below, the concept of &quot;closeness&quot; will be discussed in detail later.</p>
<h4><a name="Ping30">Ping</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">The PING RPC probes a node to see if it is online.</font>&nbsp; 
This is considered a &quot;primitive&quot; function, in that it just returns the random 
RPC ID that accompanied the Ping request.</p>
<h4><a name="Store31">Store</a></h4>
<p>STORE instructs a node to store a (key, value) pair for later retrieval.&nbsp; 
This is also considered a &quot;primitive&quot; function, as it again just returns the 
random RPC ID that accompanied the Store request.&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">To 
store a (key,value) pair, a participant locates the k closest nodes to the key 
and sends them STORE RPCS.</font>&nbsp; The participant does this by inspecting 
its own k closest nodes to the key.</p>
<h4><a name="FindNode32">Find Node</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">FIND_NODE takes a 160-bit ID as an argument. The 
recipient of a the RPC returns (IP address, UDP port, Node ID) triples for the k 
nodes it knows about closest to the target ID. These triples can come from a 
single k-bucket, or they may come from multiple k-buckets if the closest 
k-bucket is not full. In any case, the RPC recipient must return k items (unless 
there are fewer than k nodes in all its k-buckets combined, in which case it 
returns every node it knows about).</font></p>
<p>In an abstracted communication protocol, the recipient needs to return 
information about the protocol -- the kind of protocol and whatever is required 
to contact a peer using that protocol.&nbsp; If multiple protocols are 
supported, we can consider two options:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Return node information only for the protocols that the requester says 
	it supports.</li>
	<li>Alternatively (and not as good an option) is for the requester to filter 
	out returned nodes whose protocols aren't supported.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other considerations when supporting multiple protocols are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The peer itself may support multiple protocols, so it should probably 
	indicate what those are when it registers with another peer.</li>
	<li>The peer may have a preferred protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the issues of different protocols is discussed in the spec, this is 
purely my own enhancement.</p>
<p>The Find Node protocol has several purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A peer can issue this RPC on contacts it knows about, updating its own 
	list of &quot;close&quot; peers.</li>
<li>A peer may issue this RPC to discover other peers on the network.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="FindValue33">Find Value</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">FIND_VALUE behaves like FIND_NODE - returning (IP 
address, UDP port, Node ID) triples - with one exception. If the RPC recipient 
has received a STORE RPC for the key, it just returns the stored value.</font></p>
<p>If the Find Value RPC returns a list of other peers, it is up to the 
requester to continue searching for the desired value from that list.&nbsp; 
Also, note this technique for caching key-values:</p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">To find a (key,value) pair, a node starts by performing 
a lookup to find the k nodes with IDs closest to the key. However, value lookups 
use FIND_VALUE rather than FIND_NODE RPCS. Moreover, the procedure halts 
immediately when any node returns the value. For caching purposes, once a lookup 
succeeds, the requesting node stores the (key,value) pair at the closest node it 
observed to the key that did not return the value.</font></p>
<h3><a name="OtherConsiderations34">Other Considerations</a></h3>
<h4><a name="ExpirationTime35">Expiration Time</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Additionally, each node re-publishes (key,value) pairs 
as necessary to keep them alive, as described later in Section 2.5. This ensures 
persistence (as we show in our proof sketch) of the (key,value) pair with very 
high probability. For Kademlia�s current application (file sharing), we also 
require the original publisher of a (key,value) pair to republish it every 24 
hours. Otherwise, (key,value) pairs expire 24 hours after publication, so as to 
limit stale index information in the system. For other applications, such as 
digital certificates or cryptographic hash to value mappings, longer expiration 
times may be appropriate.</font></p>
<p>If we want to consider using Kademlia in a distributed ledger 
implementation, it would seem necessary that key-values never expire, otherwise 
this would result in an integrity loss of the ledger data.</p>
<h4><a name="Over-caching36">Over-caching</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Because of the uni-directionality of the topology, 
future searches for the same key are likely to hit cached entries before 
querying the closest node. During times of high popularity for a certain key, 
the system might end up caching it at many nodes. To avoid �over-caching,� we 
make the expiration time of a (key,value) pair in any node�s database 
exponentially inversely proportional to the number of nodes between the current 
node and the node whose ID is closest to the key ID. While simple LRU eviction 
would result in a similar lifetime distribution, there is no natural way of 
choosing the cache size, since nodes have no a priori knowledge of how many 
values the system will store.</font></p>
<h4><a name="BucketRefreshes37">Bucket Refreshes</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Buckets are generally kept fresh by the traffic of 
requests traveling through nodes. To handle pathological cases in which there 
are no lookups for a particular ID range, each node refreshes any bucket to 
which it has not performed a node lookup in the past hour. Refreshing means 
picking a random ID in the bucket�s range and performing a node search for that 
ID.</font></p>
<h4><a name="JoiningaNetwork38">Joining a Network</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">To join the network, a node <i>u</i> must have a 
contact to an already participating node <i>w</i>. <i>u</i> inserts <i>w</i> 
into the appropriate k-bucket. <i>u</i> then performs a node lookup for its own 
node ID. Finally, <i>u</i> refreshes all k-buckets further away than its closest 
neighbor. During the refreshes, <i>u</i> both populates its own k-buckets and 
inserts itself into other nodes� k-buckets as necessary.</font></p>
<h2><a name="NodeRequirements39">Node Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Let's cover some basic implementation requirements for a node first.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><a name="TheBigIntegerClass40">The BigInteger Class</a></h3>
<p>We could write our own byte array manipulation and comparison operators, 
which is what zencoders did, or we could use the <code>BigInteger</code> class to handle the 
range of ID's from 0 &lt;= id &lt;= 2<sup>160</sup> - 1.&nbsp; In ended up using 
<code>BigInteger</code> has simply made the code smaller.&nbsp; As a side node, I was 
impressed with Python's ability to handle these values without any special 
classes:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 ** 160
1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542976L</pre>
<h3><a name="TheNodeSpecification41">The Node Specification</a></h3>
<p> <font color="#FF00FF">Participating computers each have a node ID in the 
160-bit key space </font>(Introduction) which is simple enough.&nbsp; </p>
<h4><a name="Ambiguity#142">Ambiguity #1</a></h4>
<p>But then there's this:&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">Kademlia nodes store 
contact information about each other to route query messages. For each 0 &lt; i &lt; 
160, every node keeps a list of [contacts] of distance between 2<sup>i</sup> and 
2<sup>i+1</sup> from itself.&nbsp; We call these lists k-buckets.&nbsp; <i>k</i> 
is chosen such that any given k nodes are very unlikely to fail within an hour 
of each other (for example k = 20). </font>
(Section 2.2)<font color="#FF00FF"> </font>
How is this distance defined?&nbsp; Is this the XOR distance or the integer 
distance?&nbsp; And when the spec says &quot;distance from itself&quot;, what two values 
are being compared?&nbsp; Why even make this comparison?</p>
<h4><a name="Contradiction#143">Contradiction #1</a></h4>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">Initially, a node u�s routing tree has a single node� 
one k-bucket covering the entire ID space.</font>&nbsp; (Section 2.4)&nbsp; So 
from Section 2.2, we have each node contain 159 k-buckets (0 &lt; i &lt; 160) covering 
2<sup>i</sup> through 2<sup>i+1</sup>, and from Section 2.4, we have a node 
initialized with one k-bucket.&nbsp; You can see the former specification implemented 
in zencoders code:</p>
<pre>private const int BUCKET_SIZE = 20; // &quot;K&quot; in the spec
private const int NUM_BUCKETS = 8 * ID.ID_LENGTH; // One per bit in an ID

private List&lt;List&lt;Contact&gt;&gt; buckets;
private List&lt;DateTime&gt; accessTimes; // last bucket write or explicit touch
private ID ourID;

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Make a new bucket list, for holding node contacts.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=&quot;ourID&quot;&gt;The ID to center the list on.&lt;/param&gt;
public BucketList(ID ourID)
{
  this.ourID = ourID;
  buckets = new List&lt;List&lt;Contact&gt;&gt;(NUM_BUCKETS);
  accessTimes = new List&lt;DateTime&gt;();

  // Set up each bucket
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_BUCKETS; i++) 
  {
    buckets.Add(new List&lt;Contact&gt;(BUCKET_SIZE));
    accessTimes.Add(default(DateTime));
  }
}</pre>
<p>Here <code>8 * ID.ID_LENGTH</code> (8 * 20 = 160) buckets are created at the 
get go, each with 20 contacts (the suggested <i>k</i> value.)&nbsp; This is 
hard-wired in the zencoders implementation.</p>
<p>You can see the latter specification in the Brian Muller's Python code:</p>
<pre>def flush(self):
  self.buckets = [KBucket(0, 2 ** 160, self.ksize)]</pre>
<p>Here, a single bucket is created spanning the ID space.&nbsp; The Python code 
is correct because it also implements bucket splitting, which is in the second 
version of the specification.</p>
<h4><a name="Artifact#144">Artifact #1</a></h4>
<p>In the former specification, this limits the total number of contacts that 
your server can handle to 160 * 20, or 3200 contacts.</p>
<h2><a name="InitialID,Router,Contact,KBucket,BucketList,Node,andDhtImplementations45">Initial ID, Router, Contact, KBucket, BucketList, Node, and Dht Implementations</a></h2>
<p>After resolving the ambiguity and contradiction, we can implement most of the 
relevant classes.&nbsp; Note that some of the properties in the following 
implementation will be discussed later.</p>
<p>When we're all done with the initial implementation, we have this class 
model:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blue - classes</li>
	<li>Orangey - interfaces</li>
	<li>Purple - collections</li>
	<li>Green - value type fields</li>
